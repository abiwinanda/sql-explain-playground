# SQL EXPLAIN Playground

This repo provides you a simple database in your local computer which you could use to play around with SQL `EXPLAIN`. All tables and the data inside the database will be autogenerated but the indexes can be created manually by yourself.

## Set up

1. First make sure docker is installed in your computer.

2. Start a postgres container locally by running the following command in the root project directory

```sh
docker-compose up -d
```

It will start `postgres` container on local port `5432` with `postgres` username, `postgres` password, and `sql_explain_playground` database name. Feel free to change the port in `docker-compose.yml` in case this port is already in used.

3. Run npm install

```sh
npm i
```

4. Create the database by running the following commands

```sh
# create the database
npm run init

# create tables
npm run migrate

# fill in the tables with dummy data
npm run seeds
```

## How to Use EXPLAIN

To use `EXPLAIN`, simply append any of your SQL query with `EXPLAIN` keyword.

```sql
EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM ... WHERE ...
```

If you need to know the runtime performance of your query, you could use `ANALYZE` as follows

```sql
EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT * FROM ... WHERE ...
```
